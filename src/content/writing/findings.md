## It takes a lot of experience to play ranked matchmaking for long periods of time

If you've been in the Street Fighter side of the fighting game community at all, you'll know some frequent names on Twitch with followings of varying size: Brian_F, Zaferino, SMUG, ogyawn, Shine, iDom. While their skill levels and followings may differ, a commonality between them is experience. They've played the genre at a high level and can go hours and hours on matchmaking before showing signs of faltering or fatigue, especially while streaming. 

My friends and training partners who were already at high ranks when I first started playing were able to run the ranked matchmaking gauntlet for hours on end as well, though they'd show fatigue a bit earlier than the high-level players I named above.

## It's (usually) best to play ranked matchmaking in short bursts

When I tried going for hours and hours, I found that any progress that I made would inevitably be reset if I went past an hour. I found that this was reflected in my per-session league point (LP) change: shorter sessions would result in more upward progress and I usually felt that I had played better or had an easier time dealing with my opponnet. 

The higher I got in rank during my grind, the more I found that I was actually implementing combos and gameplans I had practiced against my friends and training partners.

It's sort of like weightlifting or any other exercise in its own way; the more you do at a certain repetition, the more comfortable you feel upping the tolerance threshold. Some people might simply have The Gene™ to go at it for hours and hours, but it's fine if you don't and you shouldn't force yourself to do it.

## Neutral is not that complicated

Something that has scarred my ability to understand this genre is that I treat every encounter in this game based on my experience playing FPS and RTS games; basically, I never had the youth experience of figuring out how to mash, how to play like a flowchart Ken, what the equivalent of RTS game cheese strats were, and so on. 

In games like Quake 3, you can buy time to think about your next move by strafejumping around the map trying to build up your stack (armor, health, weapons, ammo). In RTS games, you start out with a main base and a few workers, go in with a build order in mind, and adapt to your opponent over time. 

In fighting games, all of that happens over *seconds* and I'm often trying to think of my next move based on what I've done prior *when* a knockdown happens. A complaint I often have is that things are happening too fast and I don't know what to do midscreen when things get too chaotic, or when a jump happens that I'm not mentally preparing for at least 5-10 seconds prior based on the opponent's previous behavior.

At least for Street Fighter 5, I was severely overthinking my approach. This was part of a much longer session I had with [Espadah](https://metafy.gg/@espadah/sessions) where he told me I was trying to go to different layers of strategy like other games when people weren't even able to deal with my first layer of strategy (just press 5hk and 5hp). The way some people online will play, all that crap about whiff punishing and spacing never comes into the equation. Don't make some matches more complicated than they have to be.

## ... Well, it's complicated enough

At this time of writing this, a few notable players have put out content-creator videos about flowcharts, but one of the things I lacked was my own flowchart. I spent a lot of time basing my gameplay on poking in neutral and either getting a small conversion or waiting for the opponent to [do something "explosive" like jumping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpMo76lxoM) because [pokes send people into fits of rage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBEw-VUgPb4). 

As my rank rose, it wasn't really possible to continue playing like this. I tanked in points during early February of the grind because I didn't have a flowchart nor did I have any strong win conditions, and I only started to climb back once I started increasing awareness of when super would either win the round/game or get me very close.

Knowing how to play defensively is fine and it's an important skill, but not everyone is going to play like your average online warrior. You'll have to build a flowchart of punishes for common scenarios in order to save mental processing power for adjusting your tactics on the fly. Once I got proactive enough on offense, I was able to attempt to dictate the pace of combat and started climbing points towards to my previous high towards the end of February.

## You can optimize ranked grinding

Based on the character frequency chart, it's possible to make safe bets on the characters you'll most likely see in ranked matchmaking. Staple characters like Ryu, Ken, Guile, and Zangief will almost always be there and will be the ones people gravitate towards out of a sense of familiarity. Those characters I listed are part of a slightly larger group of characters commonly referred to as the "World Warriors", the original cast members of Street Fighter II.

It's definitely cheesy but another part of the optimization for rising in rank up until Da Big Boy Leagues™ is to just let the ft2 against a rare character play itself out. It's likely that they're not as adept with the character as you might think they are, and even if they are, you can huff some copium by saying that you're trading LP for a replay to look back on for future info.

Scrubquotes-y, but based on my data and the character prevalence in tournaments, you could take a deep breath of copium and go so far as to write off losses to characters like Blanka, Honda, Dan, etc., because they're like comets that pass through every couple hundred years and you're always just going to get scrubbed out by them. Not a great attitude but it can work.

## Don't immediately try things you've learned in lobbies while playing ranked matchmaking, but introduce them slowly

The best way to do things like integrate counter-hit combos and spacing traps into your repetoire as an intermediate player is to follow this pattern:
1. Practice the basic sequence in training mode
2. Once you have some muscle memory down, set the training dummy to randomly perform actions (i.e., for counter-hit combos set random block, for oki set random getup) and do the action you're practicing after confirming a hit
3. Try it out on a friend or training partner in a lobby and keep trying it until you get used to doing it as an option
4. Finally, try it in ranked matchmaking. If you'd like more practice time before taking it to ranked, try it in casual matchmaking, though your opponents might play somewhat differently 

This is one of the core tenants of the genre. It's like learning shock combos in Unreal Tournament, a build order in StarCraft, rollouts in Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty; you practice, implement, and periodically give yourself refreshers on them until you die. If you're an intermediate player who wants to keep going to a local or tournaments, you signed up for this.

## Find a group to practice with

You *can* go it alone, but it's way easier to find people to play with in lobbies. Be warned: running sets will be an entirely different world versus playing ranked matchmaking (or matchmaking in general) but finding a group of people who are not only people you'd consider friends but also more experienced than you is a massive game changer.

I see a lot of people approach playing with others in sets with an overenthusiastic mindset of "hehe yeah getting my ass beat is all part of the experience" but your newfound group/friends can be great players but be awful explainers when you finally do have a question, which is why I don't really like this mindset.

The mindset I would probably espouse if your group *doesn't* have good explainers is "I'm here to play some ${fightingGame} with my friends, and I want to try to do **x**" where x is something small, tangible, and realistic like "land this light > light > special combo as a punish when my friend inevitably misspaces their good-but-minus button".

The more you practice with a group with that mindset, the more they get to know about you and your playstyle. Even if they aren't the best explainers, they can find gaps in your gameplay and offer what they know, even if it's just "you don't do ${thing} so I just feel comfortable doing ${otherThing}".

Side note: bad explainers can also take the opposite form of being overly-wordy, delving quickly into theoreticals, mental exercises, and mindsets. There was a certain individual who frequented several character discords in Street Fighter 5 who would interject themselves into conversations spurred from questions, bringing all of their ultra gold experience to bear with little impact.

## Matchups MOSTLY don't matter until you hit the big time

Until you reach reasonable competence, [matchups don't matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts9TGTZfLsk). Mostly. In Street Fighter 5, I was horrible in the Alex matchup, which is a Chun-Li favored matchup. Same with Zangief. I had to lab and grind those matchups for a LONG time until I started winning against both characters consistently.

However, the opposite can also happen. Going back to Street Fighter 5, the Dhalsim matchup for Chun-Li is borderline impossible because her answers to his strategies do not feed particularly well into her win condition. I still managed to beat some Dhalsim players during my climb because they weren't well-versed in the matchup or they were simply doing a poor job. That matchup was still hell and basically borderline impossible once there was a drop of Dhalsim competence introduced to the equation.

The Guile matchup for Chun-Li was also Guile-favored because his buttons and movement were almost as good as hers while having an exceptionally strong inherent defensive style. However, with some labbing and discussion with friends, training partners, and teachers, I was able to overcome the Guile matchup more often than I realized.

If you're just starting, you'll lose matchups that favor your character and win ones that don't. It all comes down to experience. However, once you get a reasonable amount of experience, you'll start to see why your character wins/loses a matchup.

## If possible, find known skilled players to help you

Not exactly an easy feat, but I think this really helped my understanding of fighting games overall. The communities I joined and enjoyed being in had extremely competent players, which made for tough practice. I played against two extremely high ranked Alex players in Street Fighter 5 and it had an impact on my view of the matchup: it was extremely rough and I didn't understand how Alex possibly suffered in the matchup. 

Turns out that they were just THAT GOOD and most Alex players I was up against in ranked were not playing to their level; as I played against my friends, I got to understand the matchup at a more nuanced level and as I played ranked, I saw the edge she has in the matchup since my opponents were that much worse.

I also had a lot of guidance from high-level players like [Zaferino](https://www.twitch.tv/zaferino1) and [Espadah](https://www.twitch.tv/espadah). In addition to being high-level players, they were divorced from my day-to-day gameplay and able to hone in on things that I was doing that were holding me back.

## It's not a bad idea to enter a tournament for the experience but...

If you decide to go the competitive route or go to your local, getting tournament experience decently early into your experience with a fighting game is a good choice. I got experience when ogyawn was running Battle for the Bruce Lee II and it was pretty good since I was in base Platinum and had somewhat of an idea what it meant to play a competitive game.

The worst part of tournaments for lower-level players is that unless the tournament is specifically catered as a learning experience or is rank-limited, it's very easy to lose both your winner's and loser's matches (commonly referred to as "going 0 and 2") and feel like you wasted your time.

If you can enter a netplay tournament, it's not a bad idea, but be fully aware of what you're getting yourself into and you may likely find yourself out of the bracket with the quickness.
