## It takes a lot of experience to play ranked matchmaking for long periods of time

If you've been in the Street Fighter side of the fighting game community at all, you'll know some frequent names on Twitch with followings of varying size: Brian_F, Zaferino, SMUG, ogyawn, Shine, iDom. While their skill levels and followings may differ, a commonality between them is experience. They've played the genre at a high level and can go hours and hours on matchmaking before showing signs of faltering or fatigue, especially while streaming. 

My friends and training partners who were already at high ranks when I first started playing were able to run the ranked matchmaking gauntlet for hours on end as well, though they'd show fatigue a bit earlier than the high-level players I named above.

## It's (usually) best to play ranked matchmaking in short bursts

When I tried going for hours and hours, I found that any progress that I made would inevitably be reset if I went past an hour. I found that this was reflected in my per-session league point (LP) change: shorter sessions would result in more upward progress and I usually felt that I had played better or had an easier time dealing with my opponnet. 

The higher I got in rank during my grind, the more I found that I was actually implementing combos and gameplans I had practiced against my friends and training partners.

It's sort of like weightlifting or any other exercise in its own way; the more you do at a certain repetition, the more comfortable you feel upping the tolerance threshold. Some people might simply have The Geneâ„¢ to go at it for hours and hours, but it's fine if you don't and you shouldn't force yourself to do it.

## You don't have to rematch if you think someone's playing like an asshole and you're not getting anything out of it

This is probably one of the more detailed takeaways that took some time to rationalize as someone who's competed for fun for a **long** time. I actually thought about this and talked about it at length when someone I knew was going through a similar issue during Street Fighter 6. 

The feelings of taking the game and improvement at it seriously are addictive: do bad, go lab, run it back, do good = feel good. Yet at the end of the day, Street Fighter is a video game, and video games are meant to be fun experiences where we can challenge ourselves and experience cool things. 

Some people play video games to make other people miserable, and that's what's fun for them. One of my FPS crews eventually took up a mantra of "I'm not happy 'till you're not happy" when it came to dealing with people in pub servers and matchmaking because there are so many annoying and volatile personalities online. Another crew I roll with adopted this mantra without ever hearing it because of the exact same thing: people just trying to make the experience miserable or otherwise not fun.

When I was playing Tribes Ascend in pubs, we ran "counter offensives" where if someone was being a controlling loser or trying to make their dollar store version of a griefing video, we turned the tables on them. Some of my Hell Let Loose clips on my YouTube channel are based around the result of that kind of thing. If they were to deny us, we would deny them: either we'd find our own thing to do or bounce.

As I progressed through the ranked grind to Diamond, several games were like this. Sure, you never know until you play it out, but sometimes people are just looking to cheese some alt account they made to Diamond and it's really obvious. Fuck 'em. Win or lose, just dip. You are not in a tournament where you gotta ride or die through that kind of gameplay, and you'll already be practicing to deal with that in so many other ranked matches already.

Some young bloods and those of a more aggressive disposition might think of this as "running away", so let me present two notions:

1. If you're on a losing streak, do you *really* need something else on top of all the shit you're dealing with during a given session? Not even just something else, but something *extremely stupid* that you'd probably deal with easily in the right state of mind? You're already malding about something, and malding drains energy that you're not aware of: don't add something else to the pile of shit that'll just burn you out even faster.

2. "We're born with a limited number of fucks in our body"

There was an excellent article from the Smithsonian about how older people are typically better at controlling their emotions (the wisened old senseis) that was shared on HackerNews. [One commentor said the following:](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27128966)

> My entirely unscientific theory is that like other cells, we're born with a limited number of fucks in our body. When we're young, we (instinctively, subconsciously) feel like our fucks reserves are plentiful, so we give a fuck about a lot of stuff.
>
> When we're young, we (instinctively, subconsciously) feel like our fucks reserves are plentiful, so we give a fuck about a lot of stuff. As we get older, our reservoir of fucks gets progressively depleted. The fucks are rarer, so we give a fuck less and less often. 
>
> I've recently turned 40 and I can definitely feel this in myself; just like recovery from workouts takes a little longer than when I was 20, I don't give a fuck about things so easily. 
> 
> By the time you're officially old, you're almost out of fucks, so it's not like you don't give a fuck because you don't want to, but because it's more difficult physically (harvesting of the last fucks takes more energy, because biology). 
>
> Brb, submitting to Nature.

[The article itself is really good](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-older-individuals-have-greater-control-their-feelings-180977693/) and I suggest reading it if you want to find your middle ground where you're not burning through your limited supply of fucks to give to assholes on ranked.

## Neutral is not that complicated

Something that has scarred my ability to understand this genre is that I treat every encounter in this game based on my experience playing FPS and RTS games; basically, I never had the youth experience of figuring out how to mash, how to play like a flowchart Ken, what the equivalent of RTS game cheese strats were, and so on. 

In games like Quake 3, you can buy time to think about your next move by strafejumping around the map trying to build up your stack (armor, health, weapons, ammo). In RTS games, you start out with a main base and a few workers, go in with a build order in mind, and adapt to your opponent over time. 

In fighting games, all of that happens over *seconds* and I'm often trying to think of my next move based on what I've done prior *when* a knockdown happens. A complaint I often have is that things are happening too fast and I don't know what to do midscreen when things get too chaotic, or when a jump happens that I'm not mentally preparing for at least 5-10 seconds prior based on the opponent's previous behavior.

At least for Street Fighter 5, I was severely overthinking my approach. This was part of a much longer session I had with [Espadah](https://metafy.gg/@espadah/sessions) where he told me I was trying to go to different layers of strategy like other games when people weren't even able to deal with my first layer of strategy (just press 5hk and 5hp). The way some people online will play, all that crap about whiff punishing and spacing never comes into the equation. Don't make some matches more complicated than they have to be.

## ... Well, it's complicated enough

At this time of writing this, a few notable players have put out content-creator videos about flowcharts, but one of the things I lacked was my own flowchart. I spent a lot of time basing my gameplay on poking in neutral and either getting a small conversion or waiting for the opponent to [do something "explosive" like jumping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpMo76lxoM) because [pokes send people into fits of rage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBEw-VUgPb4). 

As my rank rose, it wasn't really possible to continue playing like this. I tanked in points during early February of the grind because I didn't have a flowchart nor did I have any strong win conditions, and I only started to climb back once I started increasing awareness of when super would either win the round/game or get me very close.

Knowing how to play defensively is fine and it's an important skill, but not everyone is going to play like your average online warrior. You'll have to build a flowchart of punishes for common scenarios in order to save mental processing power for adjusting your tactics on the fly. Once I got proactive enough on offense, I was able to attempt to dictate the pace of combat and started climbing points towards to my previous high towards the end of February.

## Improvement isn't a straight line, but you can tell when you're clearly not doing well

For my sessions in February leading into early March, I actually *was* improving in LP steadily. However, if you look at that stretch of time as **individual games**, my LP change was way more erratic. It was easy to drop 100 or 300 LP either in one bad loss streak or over time as I lost more than I won. In some parts of that stretch, I'd spike 300 LP on occasion, waver and bleed out some LP, then spike again.

This part of playing felt awful. I felt like I wasn't gonna make it a *lot* because I just kept swinging back and forth and felt stuck. This project has helped me quantify that points represent your consistency more than your actual skill level. I don't suggest that *you* do the same thing I did, but maybe just have a basic Excel sheet where you log the date, your starting rank points, and your ending rank points. Can even use Excel to make your own line graph to chart the delta.

A nice thing about charts is that they help visualize change, but a bad thing about charts is that if they don't have enough data, they won't paint a clear picture of that change. Recently, Zaferino posted this in his public Fighter Academy Discord:

![Progress](https://i.imgur.com/9hbkfHwl.jpg)

There's a lot of feel-good vibes about this tweet (shut up they're tweets) but there's also a lot of reality in it as demonstrated in my own progress to Diamond in SF5. On a micro level, one where I'm intimately aware of how my LP fluctuated hard over the course of a few games, I felt like I wasn't doing well. On a macro level, the numbers don't lie: it was slow, but there was steady and upwards improvement until I took off. 

If you're growing exponentially rather than logarithmically and you zoom in on the start of the chart, it looks like you're doing **hella** shitty and someone else is doing much better. Zoom out, and if you're on that exponential track, you're doing really well and catching up while logarithmic gamer is stagnating.

However, motivation, charts, and feel-good quotes only go so far, and you *need* a healthy dose of realism in your mental. I lost about 1.5k LP after my session on January 9th. In a moment like that, you have to be straight *tippin'* off that copium to write that kind of loss off as just a minor setback in consistency. If you've been treading water in a single rank for a while but you "feel" like a better player, you gotta reach out and ask for some help. Sometimes all it takes is a nudge, sometimes it takes more.

## You can optimize ranked grinding

Based on the character frequency chart, it's possible to make safe bets on the characters you'll most likely see in ranked matchmaking. Staple characters like Ryu, Ken, Guile, and Zangief will almost always be there and will be the ones people gravitate towards out of a sense of familiarity. Those characters I listed are part of a slightly larger group of characters commonly referred to as the "World Warriors", the original cast members of Street Fighter II.

It's definitely cheesy but another part of the optimization for rising in rank up until Da Big Boy Leaguesâ„¢ is to just let the ft2 against a rare character play itself out. It's likely that they're not as adept with the character as you might think they are, and even if they are, you can huff some copium by saying that you're trading LP for a replay to look back on for future info.

Scrubquotes-y, but based on my data and the character prevalence in tournaments, you could take a deep breath of copium and go so far as to write off losses to characters like Blanka, Honda, Dan, etc., because they're like comets that pass through every couple hundred years and you're always just going to get scrubbed out by them. Not a great attitude but it can work.

## Don't immediately try things you've learned in lobbies while playing ranked matchmaking, but introduce them slowly

The best way to do things like integrate counter-hit combos and spacing traps into your repetoire as an intermediate player is to follow this pattern:
1. Practice the basic sequence in training mode
2. Once you have some muscle memory down, set the training dummy to randomly perform actions (i.e., for counter-hit combos set random block, for oki set random getup) and do the action you're practicing after confirming a hit
3. Try it out on a friend or training partner in a lobby and keep trying it until you get used to doing it as an option
4. Finally, try it in ranked matchmaking. If you'd like more practice time before taking it to ranked, try it in casual matchmaking, though your opponents might play somewhat differently 

This is one of the core tenants of the genre. It's like learning shock combos in Unreal Tournament, a build order in StarCraft, rollouts in Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty; you practice, implement, and periodically give yourself refreshers on them until you die. If you're an intermediate player who wants to keep going to a local or tournaments, you signed up for this.

## Find a group to practice with

You *can* go it alone, but it's way easier to find people to play with in lobbies. Be warned: running sets will be an entirely different world versus playing ranked matchmaking (or matchmaking in general) but finding a group of people who are not only people you'd consider friends but also more experienced than you is a massive game changer.

I see a lot of people approach playing with others in sets with an overenthusiastic mindset of "hehe yeah getting my ass beat is all part of the experience" but your newfound group/friends can be great players but be awful explainers when you finally do have a question, which is why I don't really like this mindset.

The mindset I would probably espouse if your group *doesn't* have good explainers is "I'm here to play some ${fightingGame} with my friends, and I want to try to do **x**" where x is something small, tangible, and realistic like "land this light > light > special combo as a punish when my friend inevitably misspaces their good-but-minus button".

The more you practice with a group with that mindset, the more they get to know about you and your playstyle. Even if they aren't the best explainers, they can find gaps in your gameplay and offer what they know, even if it's just "you don't do ${thing} so I just feel comfortable doing ${otherThing}".

Side note: bad explainers can also take the opposite form of being overly-wordy, delving quickly into theoreticals, mental exercises, and mindsets. There was a certain individual who frequented several character discords in Street Fighter 5 who would interject themselves into conversations spurred from questions, bringing all of their ultra gold experience to bear with little impact.

## Matchups MOSTLY don't matter until you hit the big time

Until you reach reasonable competence, [matchups don't matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts9TGTZfLsk). Mostly. In Street Fighter 5, I was horrible in the Alex matchup, which is a Chun-Li favored matchup. Same with Zangief. I had to lab and grind those matchups for a LONG time until I started winning against both characters consistently.

However, the opposite can also happen. Going back to Street Fighter 5, the Dhalsim matchup for Chun-Li is borderline impossible because her answers to his strategies do not feed particularly well into her win condition. I still managed to beat some Dhalsim players during my climb because they weren't well-versed in the matchup or they were simply doing a poor job. That matchup was still hell and basically borderline impossible once there was a drop of Dhalsim competence introduced to the equation.

The Guile matchup for Chun-Li was also Guile-favored because his buttons and movement were almost as good as hers while having an exceptionally strong inherent defensive style. However, with some labbing and discussion with friends, training partners, and teachers, I was able to overcome the Guile matchup more often than I realized.

If you're just starting, you'll lose matchups that favor your character and win ones that don't. It all comes down to experience. However, once you get a reasonable amount of experience, you'll start to see why your character wins/loses a matchup.

## If possible, find known skilled players to help you

Not exactly an easy feat, but I think this really helped my understanding of fighting games overall. The communities I joined and enjoyed being in had extremely competent players, which made for tough practice. I played against two extremely high ranked Alex players in Street Fighter 5 and it had an impact on my view of the matchup: it was extremely rough and I didn't understand how Alex possibly suffered in the matchup. 

Turns out that they were just THAT GOOD and most Alex players I was up against in ranked were not playing to their level; as I played against my friends, I got to understand the matchup at a more nuanced level and as I played ranked, I saw the edge she has in the matchup since my opponents were that much worse.

I also had a lot of guidance from high-level players like [Zaferino](https://www.twitch.tv/zaferino1) and [Espadah](https://www.twitch.tv/espadah). In addition to being high-level players, they were divorced from my day-to-day gameplay and able to hone in on things that I was doing that were holding me back.

## It's not a bad idea to enter a tournament for the experience but...

If you decide to go the competitive route or go to your local, getting tournament experience decently early into your experience with a fighting game is a good choice. I got experience when ogyawn was running Battle for the Bruce Lee II and it was pretty good since I was in base Platinum and had somewhat of an idea what it meant to play a competitive game.

The worst part of tournaments for lower-level players is that unless the tournament is specifically catered as a learning experience or is rank-limited, it's very easy to lose both your winner's and loser's matches (commonly referred to as "going 0 and 2") and feel like you wasted your time.

If you can enter a netplay tournament, it's not a bad idea, but be fully aware of what you're getting yourself into and you may likely find yourself out of the bracket with the quickness.
