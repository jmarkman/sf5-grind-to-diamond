# About

Tracking progress in fighting games is difficult. It's entirely possible for someone to be steadily improving yet still losing, and conversely one can stagnate but go on daily win streaks.

One way for average players without lengthy tournament records to track their growth and progress is their progression in "rank" in online matchmaking. In Street Fighter 5 circa 2018 onward, the player ranks started at Rookie and ended at Warlord. 

Traditionally, Diamond rank was treated as the benchmark of general fighting game readiness - those who reached Diamond were no longer limited to facing people within their own rank, but everyone above them as well. The act of getting to various ranks is considered a ["grind" or "grinding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games)), hence the name of this project.

As Street Fighter 5 was in its final months before the release of Street Fighter 6, I made a New Year's Resolution to get to Diamond. I added a lot of stipulations, such as playing every day, but the one that I stuck to was tracking my games.

While playing in both online lobbies and online ranked matchmaking, it was difficult to prove to myself that I was improving. This project helped me visualize what exactly my experience grinding was like. I don't have any natural acumen for fighting games and I was reliant on others for picking up the subtle nuances of advanced play, so I didn't skyrocket to the top after a year. I think the visualizations themselves are quite interesting.

A technical breakdown of this site will be available on my "real world"/professional blog.

## Takeaways from the grind

### It takes a lot of experience to play ranked matchmaking for long periods of time

If you've been in the Street Fighter side of the fighting game community at all, you'll know some frequent names on Twitch with followings of varying size: Brian_F, Zaferino, SMUG, ogyawn, Shine, iDom. While their skill levels and followings may differ, a commonality between them is experience. They've played the genre at a high level and can go hours and hours on matchmaking before showing signs of faltering or fatigue, especially while streaming. My friends and training partners who were already at high ranks when I first started playing were able to run the ranked matchmaking gauntlet for hours on end as well, though they'd show fatigue a bit earlier than the high-level players I named above.

### If you're looking for better reflections of things you've learned in lobbies, it's best to play ranked matchmaking in short bursts

When I tried going for hours and hours, I found that any progress that I made would inevitably be reset if I went past an hour. I found that this was reflected in my per-session league point (lp) change: shorter sessions would result in more upward progress and I usually felt that I had played better or had an easier time dealing with my opponnet. The higher I got in rank during my grind, the more I found that I was actually implementing combos and gameplans I had practiced against my friends and training partners.

### It's actually possible to optimize your ranked climb by focusing on researching the abilities of the most common characters you run into

Based on the Character Frequency Chart, it's possible to make safe bets on the characters you'll most likely see in ranked matchmaking. Staple characters like Ryu, Ken, Guile, and Zangief will almost always be there and will be the ones people gravitate towards out of a sense of familiarity. Those characters I listed are part of a slightly larger group of characters commonly referred to as the "World Warriors", the original cast members of Street Fighter II.

### Don't immediately try things you've learned in lobbies while playing ranked matchmaking

The best way to do things like integrate counter-hit combos and spacing traps into your repetoire as an intermediate player is to follow this pattern:
1. Practice the basic sequence in training mode
2. Once you have some muscle memory down, set the training dummy to randomly perform actions (i.e., for counter-hit combos set random block, for oki set random getup) and do the action you're practicing after confirming a hit
3. Try it out on a friend or training partner in a lobby and keep trying it until you get used to doing it as an option
4. Finally, try it in ranked matchmaking. If you'd like more practice time before taking it to ranked, try it in casual matchmaking, though your opponents might play somewhat differently 

### Matchups MOSTLY don't matter until you hit the big time

Until you reach reasonable competence, [matchups don't matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts9TGTZfLsk&t=243s). Mostly. In Street Fighter 5, I was horrible in the Alex matchup, which is a Chun-Li favored matchup. Same with Zangief. I had to lab and grind those matchups for a LONG time until I started winning against both characters consistently.

However, the opposite can also happen. Also in Street Fighter 5, the Dhalsim matchup for Chun-Li is borderline impossible because her answers to his strategies do not feed into her win condition. I still managed to beat some Dhalsim players during my climb because they weren't well-versed in the matchup or they were simply doing a poor job. That matchup was still hell and basically borderline impossible once there was a drop of Dhalsim competence introduced to the equation.

The Guile matchup for Chun-Li was also Guile-favored because his buttons and movement were almost as good as hers while having an exceptionally strong inherent defensive style. However, with some labbing and discussion with friends, training partners, and teachers, I was able to overcome the Guile matchup more often than I realized.

### Find high-ranked players to help you

Not exactly an easy feat, but I think this really helped my understanding of fighting games overall. The communities I joined and enjoyed being in had extremely competent players, which made for tough practice. I played against two extremely high ranked Alex players in Street Fighter 5 and it had an impact on my view of the matchup: it was extremely rough and I didn't understand how Alex possibly suffered in the matchup. Turns out that they were just THAT GOOD and most Alex players I was up against in ranked were not playing to their level; as I played against my friends, I got to understand the matchup at a more nuanced level and as I played ranked, I saw the edge she has in the matchup since my opponents were that much worse.

I also had a lot of guidance from high-level players like [Zaferino](https://www.twitch.tv/zaferino1) and [Espadah](https://www.twitch.tv/espadah). In addition to being high-level players, they were divorced from my day-to-day gameplay and able to hone in on things that I was doing that were holding me back.
