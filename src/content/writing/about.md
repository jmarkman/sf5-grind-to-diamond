Tracking progress in fighting games is difficult. It's entirely possible for someone to be steadily improving yet still losing, and conversely one can stagnate but go on daily win streaks.

One way for average players without lengthy tournament records to track their growth and progress is their progression in "rank" in online matchmaking. In Street Fighter 5 circa 2018 onward, the player ranks started at Rookie and ended at Warlord. 

Traditionally, Diamond rank was treated as the benchmark of general fighting game readiness - those who reached Diamond were no longer limited to facing people within their own rank, but everyone above them as well. The act of getting to various ranks is considered a ["grind" or "grinding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games)), hence the name of this project.

As Street Fighter 5 was in its final months before the release of Street Fighter 6, I made a New Year's Resolution to get to Diamond. I added a lot of stipulations, such as playing every day, but the one that I stuck to was tracking my games.

While playing in both online lobbies and online ranked matchmaking, it was difficult to prove to myself that I was improving. This project helped me visualize what exactly my experience grinding was like. I don't have any natural acumen for fighting games and I was reliant on others for picking up the subtle nuances of advanced play, so I didn't skyrocket to the top after a year. I think the visualizations themselves are quite interesting.

A technical breakdown of this site will be available on my "real world"/professional blog. If you've found this site as someone not invested in fighting games (or even video games), [take a gander at this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCUlBX8E2BU).
